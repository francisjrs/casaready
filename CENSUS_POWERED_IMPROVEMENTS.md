# Census-Powered Lead Magnet Improvements
## Alex Hormozi Value Stack Framework + TREC Compliance

> **Goal**: Transform the wizard from a "qualification form" into an irresistible value-delivery machine that makes users feel like they're getting a $10,000 consultation for free.

## 🎯 CORE PHILOSOPHY (Hormozi-Style)

**Current State**: We ask questions → Generate basic report
**New State**: We deliver MASSIVE value at every step → Users BEG to give us their info

### The Value Stack Formula
```
Perceived Value = Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Success
                  ───────────────────────────────────────────────
                  Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice
```

## 💰 CENSUS DATA: THE SECRET WEAPON

### Current Problem
- Census data fetched but NOT used in AI recommendations
- User doesn't see the value of entering their city
- We're sitting on a goldmine and showing users rocks

### The Opportunity
Census data gives us:
- Real median home values ($387K in Austin vs $180K in Waco)
- Actual unemployment rates (job market strength)
- Education levels (school quality proxy)
- Population trends (growth = appreciation potential)
- Income levels (affordability reality check)

```
📊 YOUR AUSTIN AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS

Based on REAL Austin market data (US Census Bureau):

✅ GOOD NEWS:
   Your $350K budget is 90% of Austin's median home value
   Translation: You can afford 60% of homes on the market!

   - ~1,400-1,600 sq ft

   - Average property tax: $7,200/year (included in estimate!)

🎯 PRICE POSITIONING:
   You're in the "sweet spot"
   ├─ $250K (Bottom 25%) ─ You're not scraping the bottom
   ├─ $350K (Your Budget) ─ Quality homes, good locations
   ├─ $450K (Top 25%) ─ Stretch goal with income growth
   └─ $650K+ (Luxury) ─ Not necessary for great living

⚠️ REALITY CHECK (We're keeping it real):
   Austin median home: $387,000
   Your budget: $350,000

   SOLUTIONS:
   1. Target growing suburbs (Pflugerville, Leander) - same access, 20% less
   2. First-time buyer grant: $8,500 (gets you closer!)
   3. Seller concessions: Average $5,000 (we'll negotiate this)

🔥 MARKET OPPORTUNITY:

   - Translation: Your budget is COMPETITIVE
   - Our agent can position you to WIN
```

**Psychology**: They see you're NOT just pitching. You're educating with REAL data.

## 🚀 IMPROVEMENT #3: AI PROMPT ENHANCEMENT

### Current Problem
AI doesn't receive Census data → Generic recommendations

### Solution: Pass Census Context to AI

**New AI Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
// Add to wizard-stream/route.ts
const fullPlanInput = {
  ...privacySafePlanInput,
  marketIntelligence: {
    census: {
      cityName: wizardData.city,
      medianHomeValue: censusData.demographics.medianHomeValue,
      medianIncome: censusData.demographics.medianHouseholdIncome,
      unemployment: censusData.demographics.unemploymentRate,
      population: censusData.demographics.population,
      marketTrend: censusData.economicIndicators.marketTrend,
      costOfLivingIndex: censusData.economicIndicators.costOfLiving,
      insights: censusData.recommendations
    },
    userPositioning: {
      budgetVsMedian: (wizardData.targetPrice / censusData.demographics.medianHomeValue * 100).toFixed(1),
      incomeVsMedian: (wizardData.annualIncome / censusData.demographics.medianHouseholdIncome * 100).toFixed(1),
      affordabilityRating: calculateAffordabilityRating(wizardData, censusData)
    }
  }
}
```

**Enhanced AI Prompt:**
```
You are a TOP 1% real estate advisor in {city}, Texas.

CRITICAL MARKET CONTEXT (US Census Bureau 2024):
- Median home value in {city}: ${medianHomeValue}
- Market trend: {marketTrend}
- Unemployment: {unemployment}% (job market strength)
- Population: {population} ({growing/stable/declining})

USER'S MARKET POSITION:
- Their budget is {budgetVsMedian}% of area median
- Their income is {incomeVsMedian}% of area median
- Affordability rating: {Strong/Moderate/Challenging}

YOUR TASK:
1. Give SPECIFIC advice for {city} market (not generic)
2. Reference REAL census data in recommendations
3. Address their competitive position honestly
4. Provide tactical next steps for THIS market

Example: Don't say "Austin has a hot market"
Say: "Austin's median home hit $387K, up 5.2% this year. With your $350K budget,
you're positioned for Pflugerville/Leander suburbs where medians are $280K and
appreciation is HIGHER (6.8% vs Austin's 5.2%). This is actually BETTER for ROI."
