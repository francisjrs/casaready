# Lead Classification System - Integration Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

The holistic lead classification system is now **fully integrated** into both production and testing APIs. Every buyer profile is automatically classified into 1 of 16 specialized lead types, and receives customized AI prompts tailored to their specific situation.

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. **Core Classification Engine** (`/src/lib/services/lead-classifier.ts`)
- **360+ lines** of TypeScript logic
- **16 distinct lead types** with priority-based classification
- **Comprehensive lead profiling** including:
  - Employment classification (ITIN, W2, Self-Employed, Retired, etc.)
  - Credit tier analysis (EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, POOR)
  - DTI (Debt-to-Income) calculation
  - Loan eligibility determination
  - Risk factors and strength identification
  - Special considerations flagging

#### The 16 Lead Types:
| Lead Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ITIN_FIRST_TIME` | ITIN taxpayer, first-time buyer |
| `ITIN_INVESTOR` | ITIN taxpayer, investment property |
| `ITIN_UPSIZING` | ITIN taxpayer, upsizing/move-up buyer |
| `SELF_EMPLOYED_FIRST_TIME` | 1099/self-employed, first-time |
| `SELF_EMPLOYED_INVESTOR` | 1099/self-employed, investor |
| `SELF_EMPLOYED_UPSIZING` | 1099/self-employed, upsizing |
| `W2_FIRST_TIME_LOW_CREDIT` | W2 employee, first-time, credit <680 |
| `W2_FIRST_TIME_GOOD_CREDIT` | W2 employee, first-time, credit ≥680 |
| `W2_INVESTOR` | W2 employee, investor |
| `W2_UPSIZING` | W2 employee, upsizing |
| `MILITARY_VETERAN_FIRST_TIME` | Military/veteran, first-time |
| `MILITARY_VETERAN_UPSIZING` | Military/veteran, upsizing |
| `RETIRED_BUYER` | Retired income sources |
| `HIGH_NET_WORTH` | Income >$150k, 20%+ down |
| `MIXED_INCOME_BUYER` | Mixed W2 + self-employed |
| `STANDARD_BUYER` | Fallback for edge cases |

### 2. **Intelligent Prompt Builder** (`/src/lib/services/prompt-builder.ts`)
- **350+ lines** of template logic
- **Custom prompts for each lead type** in both English and Spanish
- **Three prompt sections**:
  - Financial Analysis
  - Loan Options
  - Location Insights
- **Context-aware generation** using buyer profile data
- **Bilingual support** (en/es)

### 3. **Production API Integration** (`/src/app/api/wizard-stream/route.ts`)
- ✅ Lead classification step added
- ✅ Custom prompt generation implemented
- ✅ **Parallel mode** updated (financial, loan, location prompts)
- ✅ **Sequential mode** updated (all three sections)
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

### 4. **Test API Integration** (`/src/app/api/test-report/route.ts`)

## 🔬 Verification & Testing

### Test Results:

#### ✅ **ITIN Jarrell Scenario**
```bash
🎯 Lead Classification: ITIN_FIRST_TIME (ITIN)
💳 Credit Tier: GOOD | DTI: 5%
🏦 Eligible Loans: ITIN Portfolio Loans (Non-QM)
✅ Recommended: ITIN Portfolio Loans (Non-QM)
⚠️  Special Considerations:
   - ITIN documentation required
   - Higher down payment needed (10-20%)
   - Limited to portfolio lenders
📝 Custom prompts generated for ITIN_FIRST_TIME
```

**What the AI now tells ITIN borrowers:**
- ❌ **NOT eligible**: FHA, VA, Conventional (requires SSN)
- ✅ **ONLY option**: ITIN Portfolio Loans (Non-QM)
- 📊 **Requirements**: 10-20% down, 7-8.5% rates
- 🏦 **Texas lenders**: Inlanta, Angel Oak, Defy, Athas, CrossCountry, Griffin
- ⏱️ **Timeline**: 45-60 days processing

#### ✅ **W2 First-Time Buyer Scenario**
```bash
🎯 Lead Classification: W2_FIRST_TIME_GOOD_CREDIT (W2)
💳 Credit Tier: EXCELLENT | DTI: 5%
🏦 Eligible Loans: FHA, Conventional
✅ Recommended: FHA
📝 Custom prompts generated for W2_FIRST_TIME_GOOD_CREDIT
```

**What the AI now tells W2 buyers:**
- ✅ **Eligible**: FHA, Conventional
- ❌ **Not eligible**: VA (not military)
- 💡 **Advantage**: Excellent credit gets best rates
- 📊 **Recommendation**: FHA for low down payment option

## 🚀 How It Works

### Classification Flow:
```
User completes wizard
         ↓
Wizard data collected
         ↓
classifyLead(wizardData, locale)
         ↓
Priority-based analysis:
  1. Check ITIN employment → ITIN_* types
  2. Check Military/Veteran → MILITARY_* types
  3. Check High Net Worth → HIGH_NET_WORTH
  4. Check Retired → RETIRED_BUYER
  5. Check Self-Employed → SELF_EMPLOYED_* types
  6. Check Mixed Income → MIXED_INCOME_BUYER
  7. Check W2 → W2_* types (credit-based)
  8. Fallback → STANDARD_BUYER
         ↓
Lead Profile Generated:
  - leadType
  - primaryCategory
  - creditTier
  - debtToIncome
  - loanEligibility
  - specialConsiderations
  - riskFactors
  - strengths
         ↓
buildSectionPrompts(leadProfile, wizardData)
         ↓
Custom Prompts Generated:
  - financial (tailored to lead type)
  - loanOptions (shows ONLY eligible loans)
  - location (standard for all types)
         ↓
AI generates personalized report

## 📊 Loan Eligibility Logic (Examples)

### ITIN Borrowers:
```typescript
if (employmentType === 'itin') {
  eligible: ['ITIN Portfolio Loans (Non-QM)']
  notEligible: ['FHA', 'VA', 'Conventional']
  recommended: 'ITIN Portfolio Loans (Non-QM)'
  requiresSpecialDocumentation: true
}
```

### Military/Veterans:
```typescript
if (isMilitary) {
  eligible: ['VA', 'FHA', 'Conventional']
  recommended: 'VA'
  notEligible: [] // All programs available
}
```

### Self-Employed/1099:
```typescript
if (employmentType === 'self-employed' || employmentType === '1099') {
  eligible: ['FHA', 'Conventional', 'Bank Statement Loans']
  requiresSpecialDocumentation: true
  specialConsiderations: [
    '2-year tax return requirement',
    'Higher reserve requirements'
  ]
}
```

### Investors:
```typescript
if (isInvestor) {
  eligible: ['Conventional', 'VA (if military)']
  notEligible: ['FHA (not allowed for investment properties)']
  recommended: 'Conventional'
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `/src/lib/services/lead-classifier.ts` - **CREATED**
2. ✅ `/src/lib/services/prompt-builder.ts` - **CREATED**
3. ✅ `/src/app/api/wizard-stream/route.ts` - **UPDATED** (production API)
4. ✅ `/src/app/api/test-report/route.ts` - **UPDATED** (test API)

### Import Fix Applied:
```typescript
// prompt-builder.ts
import { LeadType, type LeadProfile } from './lead-classifier'
// Changed from: import type { LeadProfile, LeadType }
// Reason: LeadType enum used at runtime in Record keys
```

### Integration Points:
```typescript
// Step 1: Classify lead
const leadProfile = classifyLead(wizardData, locale)

// Step 2: Build custom prompts
const customPrompts = buildSectionPrompts(leadProfile, wizardData)

// Step 3: Generate AI content
geminiClient.generateMarkdownAnalysisStream(
  fullPlanInput,
  GROUNDING.financial,
  customPrompts.financial,  // ← Custom prompt here
  TOKEN_LIMITS.financial,
  MODELS.financial
)
```
