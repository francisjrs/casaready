## Changes Deployed

### Fix #1: maxAffordable Showing $0 ‚úÖ

### Fix #2: VA Loan for Non-Veterans ‚úÖ
- Filters VA Loan from recommendations for non-veteran buyers
- Preserves VA Loan for actual veterans
- Adds logging for debugging

**Impact**: Loan recommendations now accurately reflect buyer eligibility

### Fix #3: Enhanced Debugging ‚úÖ
- Console logging for AI extractions
- Visibility into filtering decisions
- Easy validation of extracted values

**Impact**: Easier troubleshooting and monitoring in production

## Monitoring Plan

### Console Logs to Watch
```javascript
// Non-veteran buyers should see:
‚ö†Ô∏è  Filtering out VA Loan recommendation - user is not a veteran

// All successful reports should show:
üìä AI Response Extraction: {
  estimatedPrice: [number],
  maxAffordable: [number > 0],
  monthlyPayment: [number],
  programCount: [number],
  programs: [array]
}
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **maxAffordable = 0 occurrences** - Should be 0 (was happening before)
2. **VA Loan for non-veterans** - Should be 0 (was happening before)
3. **AI extraction failures** - Monitor fallback usage
4. **Error rates** - No increase expected

### Vercel Logs Access

## Testing in Production

### Test Case 1: Non-Veteran High Income
**URL**: https://casaready.vercel.app/wizard

**Test Data**:
- Location: Austin, TX 78701
- Income: $125,000/year
- Debts: $400/month
- Credit: 740-799
- Down Payment: 3%
- Buyer Type: relocating, downsizing (NO veteran)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ "M√°ximo Asequible" shows value > $0 (not $0)
- ‚úÖ "Programas de Pr√©stamo" does NOT include "VA Loan"
- ‚úÖ Shows "Conventional Loan" or "FHA Loan"

---

### Test Case 2: Veteran Buyer
**URL**: https://casaready.vercel.app/wizard

**Test Data**:
- Location: Austin, TX 78701
- Income: $100,000/year
- Debts: $500/month
- Credit: 680-739
- Down Payment: 0%
- Buyer Type: veteran ‚úì

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ "Maximum Affordable" shows value > $0
- ‚úÖ "Recommended Programs" INCLUDES "VA Loan"
- ‚úÖ AI text mentions VA Loan benefits

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are detected in production:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Find previous good deployment
vercel ls --prod

# Rollback to previous deployment (3 minutes ago)
vercel alias set https://casaready-ldkrhm40z-franciscos-projects-1c371564.vercel.app casaready.vercel.app

# Or revert git commit and redeploy
git revert d3eb004
git push origin main
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Rollback Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Reason**: Changes isolated to one function
- **Fallback Behavior**: Has built-in fallback logic
- **User Impact**: Minimal (fixes bugs, doesn't change working features)

---

## Success Criteria
